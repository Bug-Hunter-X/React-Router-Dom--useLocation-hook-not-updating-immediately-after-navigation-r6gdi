This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router DOM v6 where the `useLocation` hook doesn't immediately update after navigation.  The problem arises because of the asynchronous nature of route transitions.  The solution involves using the `useEffect` hook to monitor changes to the location and ensuring that any dependent components re-render accordingly.  This repository showcases the problem and the provided solution using a clear and concise approach. It's a practical example to help others avoid this typical pitfall.
